# Weather Dashboard
## Description

The Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows travelers to search for current and future weather conditions in multiple cities to help them plan their trips accordingly by providing accurate weather information.

By providing current and future weather conditions across multiple cities, the Weather Dashboard helps travelers make informed decisions about their travel plans. They can choose the best time to visit a city based on the weather conditions, avoid unsafe weather conditions, and pack and prepare accordingly.
